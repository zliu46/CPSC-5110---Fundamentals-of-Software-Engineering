Contact:

Preferred Contact for each professor

Mail:  Please use good email etiquette - use a proper greeting, include your first and last name in the signature, and put the course number either in the subject or body of the email. Expect a 24-hour response time for emails during business days, or the next business day if the email is sent over the weekend. If there is a legitimate emergency, mark your message as high priority.

Teams: Contact via Teams as per instructions.

Instructor office hours . Instructor will be available on request, and during their office hours. Grading issues, issues related to course will be priority. In certain cases if no one is waiting, instructor is available for general advice relating to CS, Resumes, or Internships. High priority is placed on making sure that you are comfortable with class.

Office hours, and email/Teams expectations:

    Feel free to come to office hours, or email if you want clarification on the assignment or want to explore a design issue. You may email or send inquiries via Teams.
    Concepts and general approaches may be discussed in the #questions channel. Specific questions, design strategies and bugs should be sent via email or Teams direct message
    Feel free to discuss CPSC 5110 or general questions regarding the program or other career advice during office hours. Note that advising questions (i.e. courses to take, registration, MSCS program, etc.) should be directed to your academic advisor; you can find this information on MySeattleU 

    Links to an external site..

Follow these steps when you send an email or use Teams to contact the professor:

    Succinctly describe what the problem is and what help you are seeking.
    Describe the incorrect behavior (include screen shots).
    List what you have done to diagnose it (include supporting info like links, code snapshots, etc.) and who you have already consulted (i.e. instructor or tutor(s)).
    Explain how your efforts at diagnosis are stuck.
    Restate what help you are asking for.

Office hours:

    Depending on how many students are waiting for help, students may be limited to 5 minutes during tutoring and office hours. After the 5 minutes, they will be put in the waiting room and if there is still time remaining, the tutor(s)/instructor will add you back to the meeting.
    You should be able to state the 5 steps above when you see the instructor(s). If not, you will be placed in the waiting room.
    Office hours will start and end at the times listed on the syllabus. Students who are not able to talk to a instructor will be asked to come back to office hours/tutoring on another day or make an appointment with the instructor. You can also email your question to the instructor.
    Though the instructor will check Teams/email occasionally throughout the day, there may be a 24-hour turnaround on your emails/messages.
    The instructor will stop responding to messages after 9pm and check emails/Teams in the morning.

A few additional tips:

    Start on HW early. Design your program and ask general or clarification questions on Teams.
    Look at the syllabus and review lecture videos/book. Try to run and trace the code covered during class.

 
Student Expectations:

Workload Expectations:      

Students are expected to keep up with the course material. As this is a 5 credit class, students should plan to spend up to 8-15 hours per week outside of class. Likely half of the time will be spent participating in a team project. Students are responsible for turning in homework in a timely fashion (refer to the Late Homework Policy) and, unless noted otherwise, to complete assignments individually (refer to the Academic Integrity Policy).

Class Conduct Expectations:

You are responsible for treating other students with respect and to minimize disruptions to the classroom. Examples of classroom disruptions include, but are not limited to: ringing cell phones, using cell phones and laptops in a distracting manner, arriving to class late, leaving class early, and leaving/reentering the classroom.

Class Announcement and Email Expectations:

Students are expected to keep up-to-date on class announcements made outside of class on a daily basis. All class announcements will be made in class and/or via Canvas. By default, Canvas will instantly send these announcements to your SU email address. If desired, you may change the settings on Canvas to send these announcements to an alternative email address.  

It is also important to check your SU email account on a daily basis as private emails initiated by the instructor could be sent to the student’s SU email address. Also, important university announcements (such as the school closing due to inclement weather) are made in this fashion.

Attendance Expectations:

Class attendance is strongly encouraged. Students missing a class are responsible for any material assigned or covered in class during their absence.  Students are encouraged to actively participate in class discussions.  Makeup lectures will not be given during office hours or at any other times.

In the event of an extended absence such as a prolonged illness, it is your responsibility to make up the missing material and catch-up with the remainder of the class as soon as possible. In this situation, to the best of your abilities, keep in contact with me during the absence and schedule a meeting with me once you are back. If an absence causes you to miss several class periods and assignments that make it very difficult for you to catch-up, you will unfortunately have to withdraw from the course.

In accordance with university policy, incomplete grades (I)

Links to an external site. are only given if an unexpected extended absence occurs at the end of the course session.

Failure to appear for an exam will result in a score of zero for that test. Makeups will only be given in extraordinary circumstances, at the discretion of the instructor, and the students must provide written documentation to the instructor and reserve a make-up time at least 24 hours in advance. Makeups may be oral.

 
Course & University Policies:

Late Homework Policy:

All assignments are due at the date and time indicated on the assignment in PST.  Late submissions will be penalized 20% per date (including weekends/holidays).  

Assignments that do not follow the submission instructions will receive a zero. Assignments will not be accepted via email. 

Late homework submissions are penalized 20% per day. For example, if an assignment is due on Monday at midnight:

1 day late -- Submission by Tue midnight -- 20% penalty
2 days late -- Submission by Wed midnight -- 40% penalty
3 days late -- Submission by Thu midnight -- 60% penalty
4 days late -- Submission by Fri midnight -- 80% penalty
5 days or more late -- 100% penalty (zero on assignment)

Note: Students often attempt to submit an assignment at 11:59, and it does not complete uploading until 12:01.  If this is the case the assignment is late and will receive the late penalty.  We strongly recommend students do not wait until the last 30 minutes to attempt to upload an assignment. The late policy will apply to all submissions marked late via Canvas.

 

Missed Class Policy:

If for any reason you miss a class, be sure to obtain notes from one of your peers to catch up. If, after going over those notes and checking the readings for the class, you still have questions, please meet me during office hours or arrange a time to discuss them. Remember to bring those notes with you so that we can work on your specific, focused questions.  

Canceled Class Policy:

If a class is canceled (likely due to inclement weather or instructor illness), the instructor has the right to make up lost class content in an online format.

Electronic Submission Policy:

 While a solution can be submitted multiple times, only the last submission will be graded as previous submissions are overwritten. Be sure to double-check your solutions as assignments will only be graded once after the due date. Any assignments (or portions of homework assignments) that are required to be submitted electronically, must be submitted electronically. Assignments submitted using other means, including email submissions, will not be accepted.

Grading Dispute Policy:

If you feel something was graded incorrectly or a math error occurred when tabulating the total score of an exam or assignment, please contact one of the instructors. All grading disputes must be sent in writing via email. Instructor might request a personal meeting if it cannot be resolved this way.  Grading disputes will only be accepted for one week; the timing of the week starts when the exam or assignment grade was first available to the student (either online or in-person). Note that we will often re-grade the assignment, which potentially could result in additional deductions to maintain consistency with the grading of all student assignments.

Health and Safety Protocols:

In this class, as elsewhere on campus, all of us—students and faculty—must comply with all Seattle University health and safety protocols

Links to an external site.

We are all part of an academic learning community in which care for one another is part of our shared responsibility and commitment that goes to the heart of our Jesuit values.  Consequently, all of us need to comply with these protocols. If you do not want to comply with the University’s health and safety protocols, then you must leave the classroom and will earn an unexcused absence for the class period and any associated assignments/assessments for the day. If you persistently deviate from the expected health and safety protocols, we will refer you to the Office of the Dean of Students because you may be in violation of the  University’s Code of Student Conduct.

Negative COVID-19 Test

Any student who plans to be physically on campus in Winter Quarter 2020 must get a negative COVID-19 test within 5 days of being on campus. Upload your test results to patient portal under “immunizations” in the Medicat patient portal, located here: https://seattleu.medicatconnect.com/

Support for Students with Disabilities:

If you have, or think you may have, a disability (including an “invisible disability” such as a learning disability, a chronic health problem, or a mental health condition) that interferes with your performance as a student in this class, you are encouraged to arrange support services and/or accommodations through Disabilities Services staff located in Loyola 100, (206) 296-5740. Disability-based adjustments to course expectations can be arranged only through this process.

Religious Accommodations:

It is the policy of Seattle University to reasonably accommodate students who, due to the observance of religious holidays, expect to be absent or endure a significant hardship during certain days of their academic course or program. Please see, Policy on Religious Accommodations for Students

Links to an external site..

Academic Integrity Policy: 

Students, unless specifically stated otherwise, are required to do all work in this course individually. Students may discuss general concepts with other students, but may not discuss assignment or implementation details with other students; please address detail/implementation questions to the TAs or the instructor. Submitted work must be original work done by the student. However, you may use class material without citation. Class material includes information that was presented in class, discussed during office hours, that appears in the textbook or lecture notes, or was provided by me (or any guest instructor). The use of external sources such as other books, open source, or the Internet must be approved by the instructor and must be cited before submitting the assignment. 

If you are in doubt whether a particular activity may be considered cheating, ask the instructor.  In addition, you are encouraged to consult the Academic Integrity Tutorial available on SU Online Academic Integrity

Links to an external site. 

Any evidence of plagiarism, collaboration, or other cheating will result in a zero for all parties concerned for the assignment or exam in question. In addition, all academic integrity violations will be reported according to the Seattle University Academic Integrity Policy. That process may enforce additional penalties and/or disciplinary action.  Please consult the Academic Integrity Policy (2011-3) for further information.

Additional notes on Academic Honesty:

    Academic Honesty is absolutely essential in order for learning to occur. You are expected to do your own work unless group work is explicitly stated in the assignment directions.
    What’s Ok
        Discuss concepts, general approaches, strategies
        Discuss bugs
    What’s Not Ok
        Debugging someone else's code
        Sharing code, homework answers, etc. via email or verbally
        Telling another student how to solve
    When meeting with teachers, and TA's, the same principles apply. We are not there to "debug" or provide answers. To accomplish this goal, it is likely that TA and Teacher interactions with students be very focused on specific issues that can be brought to there attention.
    Default policy for cheating: an F for the assignment/course and the incident is reported to the dean's office
    You will be expected to produce and understand all aspects of your work

Academic Policies on the Registrar's Website:

Be sure that you understand the Academic Integrity Policy and the Academic Grading Grievance Policy, posted on the Registrar’s website: https://www.seattleu.edu/redhawk-axis/academic-policies/

Academic Resources:

My goal is to create a learning environment in which you can be incredibly successful. we will work hard to create and improve the learning environment throughout the quarter based on my own observations of the course and your feedback on what would help you learn more. In return, we ask and encourage you to make the most of this learning opportunity. Please take advantage of the academic support services available to you at the university. Even if you have had excellent study skills in the past, it is easy to slip into suboptimal habits and these services can help you excel in your studies.

All work submitted for grading must be the student's own work. Plagiarism will result in a score of zero on the test or assignment, or dismissal from the course. Also, the Dean of Students office will be informed.

 
Community & Inclusivity:

Seattle University has a stated commitment to diversity and inclusivity. In part, this includes an expectation that all members of our campus community treat one another with respect and care in the classroom. Actions or statements which espouse the supremacy of one group of people over another, or which marginalize any group, are not welcome in our classroom. Such attitudes are destructive to both our learning process and our community. All students in this course are welcomed and valued.

Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of discrimination have no place on our campus or in our classroom. Our class, like our campus, is one community. We learn together. We work together. And we will respect one another. We teach all students, regardless of background or beliefs. All students are equally welcome and valued. Growth mindset includes our ability to grow together, to learn to be more tolerant, and to become more compassionate. No one is being asked to leave the table. Everyone is being asked to make room at the table, so that everyone has a seat and a fair chance.

If you find that anything in our class is failing to live up to these principles (including if you feel that we myself have failed to live up to them), we encourage you to bring this issue up, either to me, to the computer science department chair, your advisor, or another faculty or staff member you feel comfortable talking with, who could pass on your concerns to myself or my department chair. Alternatively, you can report such incidents through the Office of Institutional Equity
